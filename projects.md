## 1) Network Segmentation with OPNsense + VLANs

**Goal:** Trusted HTTPS for internal services.  
**What I built:** Root CA, issued certs, client trust setup, recovery notes.

## 3) DNS Filtering & Visibility with Pi-hole
**Goal:** Block malicious domains + visibility into client DNS behavior.  
**What I built:** Pi-hole + upstream DNS, conditional forwarding, dashboards.

## 4) Proxmox Baseline + VM/LXC Standards
**Goal:** Repeatable VM builds and safe recovery.
